      "heading": "Altitude Logging",
      "paragraph": "Every interesting quantity can be logged with a sampling rate of 100 Hz on the on-board flash. For an average flight time of 3 minutes/flight a total of 13 flights can be logged. The logging is started at liftoff and stopped at touchdown. If you plan on flying longer than that a logging mask can be applied, improving the logging time significantly."

      "heading": "3D State Estimation",
      "paragraph": "With the use of the accelerometer, magnetometer and gyro data we estimate the orientation accurately. This can be used to abort the second stage of two stage rocket launches or to inspect the stability of the rocket after touchdown."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Highly configurable action",
      "paragraph": "Any output (servos, gpio’s or pyro channels) can be mapped to any flight phase or timer. Any timer can be started at any given flight phase. Hence the user has full control over the control flow. For more information regarding the flight phases and I/O’s check out the documentation."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Hardware in the loop flight simulation",
      "paragraph": "If you have access to simulation tools or want to check out why something did not work out as expected on a previous flight you can inject simulated or recorded data into the flight computer for testing. With this you can verify if your configuration, timers etc are set correctly and feel confident that your rocket will land safely on the ground."
