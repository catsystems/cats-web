  "productDescription": "Vega is our general purpose flight computer. The board detects its own orientation relative to ground, removing any mounting constraints. An internal Finite State Machine implements all the flight phases. At each transition, events are thrown that can be easily configured by the user. Vega supports 2 pyro channels, 2 servo channels and general purpose I/Os for deployment events. Backup timers can also be set up.<br/><br/>Vega also implements a telemetry link to the <a href=\"/ground-station\">ground station</a>. The rocket's height, velocity, GPS coordinates, battery voltage and the current flight phase are sent down to the ground with an update rate of 10Hz. The telemetry operates at 2.4GHz and is implemented using Frequency-hopping spread spectrum. To bind your ground station to Vega, only a \"link phrase\" needs to be set on both devices. Vega is also fully functional without the ground station.<br/><br/>All relevant information (including linear acceleration, angular velocity, temperature, barometric pressure, height, velocity, GPS coordinates, current state and triggered actions) are logged to the board's internal flash chip. This data can be accessed on any computer by just connecting Vega with a USB-C cable.",
